Developing gitlib
=================

If you plan to contribute to gitlib, here are few things you should know:

Documentation generation
::::::::::::::::::::::::

Documentation is generated using Sphinx (restructured text). Configuration file
is located in https://github.com/gitonomy/website/blob/master/bin/conf.py

You will need to fetch vendor modules for PHP blocks especially. If you really
want to generate it, install the website project locally and hack into it.
